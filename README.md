# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. It's based on the famous Iris dataset and employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.

## Files
- `iris_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and species labels.
- `iris_classification.py`: The Python script that loads, preprocesses, trains, and evaluates the model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib) installed.
3. Run `iris_classification.py` to train and evaluate the model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling, feature selection)
- Hyperparameter tuning (k-value)
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Visualizations (pair plots, feature distributions)

## Results
The model's accuracy and classification report are displayed, indicating its performance in classifying Iris flowers.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different algorithms.
- Collect more data to improve model generalization.
- Consider feature engineering for better feature representation.
